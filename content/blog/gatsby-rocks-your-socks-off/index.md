1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6  
It doesn't matter if it is good, it only matters if it rocks  
The main thing that we do is to rock your socks off  
There's no such thing as a rock prodigy  
'Cause rock n' roll is bogus, right KG, right  
Only thing that really matters is a classical sauce  
And that's why me and KG are classically trained  
To rock your fuckin' socks off, give 'em a taste KG, okay  
  
That is Bach and it rocks  
It's a rock block of Bach  
That he learned in the school  
Called the school of hard knocks  
  
Give it up for KG, give it up for me  
Give it up for KG, give it up for me  
Give it up for rock, give it up for blues  
Give it up for everything that is not to lose  
Now rock your socks off woman  
We'll rock your shit up y'all  
Give it up children now to freak your shit out  
All right  
  
Now I know what a lot of you are sayin'  
I just figured out what I'm gonna do with the rest of my days  
I'm gonna get me an oversized guitar  
Gain forty pounds and be the next D  
Well, I got sour news for you, Jack, It ain't that easy  
For instance, are you willing to make the commitment to wakin' up  
At the crack a' noon for deep knee rock squats  
Seven or eight at a time in a row?  
  
How 'bout are you willing to make the commitment  
To rock hard tasty abs washer board style?  
Glistening in the sun, how 'bout are you willin' to make the commitment  
Wakin' up, goin' okay, it's gig time, what T-shirt am I gonna wear?  
Can't decide, can't decide, brain aneurysm  
We've been through so much bullshit just to be here tonight  
To rock your fuckin' socks off and all we ask in return is so precious little  
All we're askin' you to do is drop trou and squeeze out  
A cleveland steamer on my chest  
  
2, 3, 4  
Give it up for KG, give it up for me  
Give it up for KG, give it up for me  
Give it up for rock, give it up for blues  
Give it up for everything that is not to lose  
Now rock your socks off woman  
We'll rock your shit up y'all  
Give it up children, won't you freak your shit out?  
All right
